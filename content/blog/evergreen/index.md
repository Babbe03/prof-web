title: "What Creates Long-term Retention?"
subtitle: "Understanding the core tenets of long-term retention"
excerpt: "The goal of teaching is to create an acquisition of knowledge in students. Yet, many professors repeat the same tactics without knowing their efficacy. For long-term retention students need variability, separation, and strategies. Without understanding what long-term retention is built off of, a professor can never teach properly."

Despite the criticality of ensuring retention, most professors seem to abide by a fairly straight forward approach to ensuring it: "if I understand it and can explain my understanding, then they should be able to understand also". Therefore, it may be of no surprise that upon learning the material, students are better than professors at explaining the concepts in a varied way to other students. This deficit in inability to vary teaching often explains many gripes some students have with their professors. Hence, for a professor to be successful, they must fundamentally be able to do the one thing students expect of them: to teach them. 

However, given the extremely dense and varied information surrounding learning it can be hard to know where to start as a professor. This section will outline the theory needed to gain a general understanding of worthwhile ideas, which will then be expanded upon in the *Application* section. 

This discussion will be based on a paper by Healy et al. (1993) about the nature of long-term retention and what a professor will need to know in order to ensure it. Healy et al. (1993) outline three main strategies and explain how they are related to long-term retention, which will be outlined below. 

## Optimize Training Conditions 

The first point made by Healy et al. (1993) was to optimize training conditions, which means to create situations where your students can learn as much as possible. Healy et al. (1993) identified three key points that makes a situation optimized:

    1. Contextual inteference
    2. Part-whole training 
    3. Generation effect
    
Contextual interference is the usage of variability and challenge in a training situation. Instead of giving repetitive practice, giving a varied situation forces the students to adapt, use their skills, and apply their knowledge in an unknown situation. The heavier application and twisting of knowledge leads to the students working with the material significantly more, instead of simply regurgitating it, leading to higher retention, despite often leading to a slight initial dip in training performance. 

Part-whole training means to chunk a complex challenge into smaller parts that are easier to approach. This approach allows students to learn and retain smaller parts, which can be mastered before putting it all together. The gradual mastery of each individual tasks leads to a gradual mastery over the complex challenge, but allows students to approach it one-at-a-time, increasing confidence and leads to easier retention.

Generation effect is encouraging students to create their own answers and solutions during the learning process, instead of being a passive receptical. Through the generation of active answers and solutions, the process of learning becomes interactive and increases the retention of students, by having their own answers and solutions being the anchoring point for the acquisition of knowledge. 

## Optimize Learning Strategies 

Healy et al. (1993) stress the importance for students to hold optimal learning strategies, to both encode and retreive information. Without learning strategies the acquisition of knowledge becomes inefficient. There are two learning strategies according to Healy et al. (1993):

    1. Encoding Strategies 
    2. Retrieval Practice
    
Encoding strategies are any tool that helps a student form robust memories. This can be done through mnemonic devices, visualization techniques, and associations. Through this, students are able to better engrave the information in their memory, increasing their ability to work with it, and their chances of retaining it. 

Retrieval practice is the act of forcing memory recall in order to train one's ability to retrieve the information. Through retrieval practice, students are able to build up their ability of recollection, seeing if they can retrieve the information they put much effort into encoding. Examples would include spaced repetition, practice exams, and self-quizzing.

It should be apparent that these two types of learning strategies are two sides of the same coin. Encoded information becomes useless without retrieval; retrieving becomes useless without robust encoded information.

## Automatic Processing 

According to Healy et al. (1993) to secure full long-term retention, the learner needs to reach automaticity where skills and knowledge is able to be applied without conscious effort and thought. Reaching this stage is time-consuming and challenging, but a key aspect in true retention. Healy et al. (1993) outline three components of the process to automaticity:

    1. Extensive Practice
    2. Balanced Challenge and Skill Level
    3. Feedback and Correction
    
Extensive practice simply means that to reach automaticity one needs to undergo deliberate and comprehensive practice that goes well beyond the initial stages of learning. To reach a point where conscious effort is decreased in the expression of said skill and knowledge, it needs to be practiced frequently and thoughtfully. Students cannot do the same thing repeatedly, but must find new ways to express their skills in order to properly learn. Thereby, this aspect calls back to the previous headings.

Challenge needs to be balanced with the demanded skill level; if the challenge is too high it becomes discouraging, while too little challenge becomes a seemingly worthless and useless task. The skill level of the individual should be met with the practice, and the challenge should increase alongside the skill level. The balance ensures that students are able to avoid overengagement and understimulation. 

Practice sessions need feedback to ensure that students are learning the right things, and are able to intenralize the right procedure. The correction loop also helps ensure that the skill is being retained, instead of it being expressed and received in a vacuum that does not give a response. 

## Where does this leave us? 

True long-term retention is difficult to achieve, and most professors are more worried about retention for the exam, as compared to life-long retention. However, either way, students must retain information, and creating a setting where they are more likely to retain it long-term, is better in the short-term also. Even so, the demands for a good retention environment are quite hefty, with some being outside of the professors control. Despite this, under the *Application* section there will be practical applications of the ideas discussed.
