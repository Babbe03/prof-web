title: "What Creates Long-term Retention?"
subtitle: "Understanding the core tenets of long-term retention"
excerpt: "The goal of teaching is to create an acquisition of knowledge in students. Yet, many professors repeat the same tactics without knowing their efficacy. For long-term retention students need variability, separation, and strategies. Without understanding what long-term retention is built off of, a professor can never teach properly."

Despite the criticality of ensuring retention, most professors seem to abide by a fairly straight forward approach to ensuring it: "if I understand it and can explain my understanding, then they should be able to understand also". Therefore, it may be of no surprise that upon learning the material, students are better than professors at explaining the concepts in a varied way to other students. This deficit in inability to vary teaching often explains many gripes some students have with their professors. Hence, for a professor to be successful, they must fundamentally be able to do the one thing students expect of them: to teach them. 

However, given the extremely dense and varied information surrounding learning it can be hard to know where to start as a professor. This section will outline the theory needed to gain a general understanding of worthwhile ideas, which will then be expanded upon in the *Application* section. 

This discussion will be based on a paper by Healy et al. (1993) about the nature of long-term retention and what a professor will need to know in order to ensure it. Healy et al. (1993) outline three main strategies and explain how they are related to long-term retention, which will be outlined below.
