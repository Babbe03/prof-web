Many of us have a teacher or professor whom we remember fondly. That educator did something that made us feel connected to them, and subsequently more engaged and interested in the material, as well as feeling better. This is the impact of a student-teacher emotional bond. Yet, many of us do not fully understand the impact these bonds have, what they actually do, and then how to build them. This section will cover the benefits and mechanisms of a quality student-teacher bond, and the *Application* section will delve into how to build it. 

## What is the relationship built on?

In a paper by Snijders et al (2020) the relationship between a student-teacher bond and student emotions and behaviors were examined. In this paper they identified five foundational areas which the wholistic bond is built upon:

    1. Trust in benevolence
    2. Trust in honesty
    3. Affective commitment
    4. Affective conflict
    5. Satisfaction

Trust in benevolence means if the student feels that the educator has their wellbeing in mind. If the student trusts that the educator is always considering their welfare, considering the impact of their actions, and has the capability and emotional regard to be a confidant for the student. 

Trust in honesty relates to the perceived integrity of the educator by the student. If the student feels that the educator is honest and open, has a high integrity, and seems trustworthy, then the trust in the honesty of the educator becomes high. 

Affective commitment is if the student feels emotionally attached to the teacher. If they enjoy their presence, seeks to talk to them, likes being associated with them, and if they are happy about their relationship. Affective commitment is often what one thinks about when discussing student-teacher bond. 

Affective conflict is the opposite of Affective commitment, here the question being asked is if the student is in conflict with the teacher. Does the student feel angry, frustrated, and annoyed with the educator. 

Satisfaction is a measure of the student's feelings of content with the performance of the educator. The question being asked here is if the student is happy with how the educator has performed.
