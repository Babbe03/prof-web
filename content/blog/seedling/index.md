Many of us have a teacher or professor whom we remember fondly. That educator did something that made us feel connected to them, and subsequently more engaged and interested in the material, as well as feeling better. This is the impact of a student-teacher emotional bond. Yet, many of us do not fully understand the impact these bonds have, what they actually do, and then how to build them. This section will cover the benefits and mechanisms of a quality student-teacher bond, and the *Application* section will delve into how to build it. 

## What is the relationship built on?

In a paper by Snijders et al (2020) the relationship between a student-teacher bond and student emotions and behaviors were examined. In this paper they identified five foundational areas which the wholistic bond is built upon:

    1. Trust in benevolence
    2. Trust in honesty
    3. Affective commitment
    4. Affective conflict
    5. Satisfaction

Trust in benevolence means if the student feels that the educator has their wellbeing in mind. If the student trusts that the educator is always considering their welfare, considering the impact of their actions, and has the capability and emotional regard to be a confidant for the student. 

Trust in honesty relates to the perceived integrity of the educator by the student. If the student feels that the educator is honest and open, has a high integrity, and seems trustworthy, then the trust in the honesty of the educator becomes high. 

Affective commitment is if the student feels emotionally attached to the teacher. If they enjoy their presence, seeks to talk to them, likes being associated with them, and if they are happy about their relationship. Affective commitment is often what one thinks about when discussing student-teacher bond. 

Affective conflict is the opposite of Affective commitment, here the question being asked is if the student is in conflict with the teacher. Does the student feel angry, frustrated, and annoyed with the educator. 

Satisfaction is a measure of the student's feelings of content with the performance of the educator. The question being asked here is if the student is happy with how the educator has performed.


## Impact on student emotions

What Snijders et al (2020) found was that students with a higher perceived student-teacher bond would have higher rates of student engagement and student loyalty. 

By student engagement Snijderes et al (2020) mean absorption, dedication, and vigor; how much the student is engrossed in the material, committed to studying and proud of it, and zealous about studying the material respectively. When the students had a higher quality bond with their faculty, their dedication and vigor was significantly increased, leading to the students being more committed to studying and had an increased positive attitude to studying the material. Furthermore, dedication was strongly correlated with affective commitment, indicating that the act of enjoying your teacher's presence cna lead to increased willingness to study. 

Furthermore, the increase of student engagement and a high-quality bond between student and faculty, lead to an increase in student loyalty, which Snijders et al (2020) describe as student's feelings of connection to the institution and faculty, and how their behaviors relate to it. The findings indicate that when students are more emotionally connected to their facultym they are more likely to feel connected to the university as a whole, and express behaviors that reflect that connection. These behaviors could be recommending courses and professors, keeping in touch with faculty, continuing the study of the taught subject, and express satisfaction about university and course choices. 

Another study by Goetz et al (2021) found significant statistical relationships with a quality student-teacher bond and positive student emotions, such as enjoyment and pride. Furthermore, they found a negative relationship with negative emotions such as boredom, shame, anger, and anxiety. 

These findings suggest that for a student, a quality student-teacher bond becomes a facilitator of positive, encouraging emotions, while staving off and protecting against negative emotions. When considering a student's emotional range this becomes quite significant; students constantly deal with suppressing anxiety, boredom, frustration, and anger, while trying to get themselves motivated and find enjoyment in the class. Because of this, the importance of the emotional bond cannot be understated.

## Each relationship has different needs

In their paper, Snijders et al(2020) explain that while student-teacher bonds are of vital importance, they are also highly varied. They continue by saying that what each student needs varies, and the demands and contributions of the relationship has to then vary also. The implications of this variability means that professors cannot expect all relationships to be built the same and to progress the same. While some students might build a strong emotional bond immediately with the professor, others might not. It then becomes imperative to understand what the students need in order to progress the bond, and to not assume that all students will react the same.

## Where does this leave us?

In conclusion, student-teacher bonds have a strong impact on student emotions and thereby academic outcomes. The emotional bond is able to create a larger feeling of positive emotions, while protecting the student from negative emotions. However, not all bonds are created the same, and the variability in student's desires and expectations provides a unique problem to the construction of these bonds. For practical ways of building and applying these bonds, go to the *Application* section.
