title: "What drives student Motivation?"
subtitle: "Understanding and being able to foster motivation"
excerpt: "Motivation is why we do what we do, and getting students to do anything requires them to be motivated. If you desire to get your students to do work, listen to you talk, and show up to class, you have to understand what drives and motivated them. Without that understanding you are left trying to forcibly drag a horse, when all it requires is a pat and a nudge."

## Motivation is both socially- and self-determined

Ryan and Deci (2020), performed research on motivation across fields based on fundamental psychological needs. They postulated that humans have an innate inclination toward activity, curiosity, and integration, but deal with a vulnerability toward passivity. According to Ryan and Deci (2020), the social context becomes then crucial, either enforcing the innate inclination, or exploiting the vulnerability. 

This became the foundation for the Self-Determination Theory (SDT).
