title: "What drives student Motivation?"
subtitle: "Understanding and being able to foster intrinsic motivation"
excerpt: "Motivation is why we do what we do, and getting students to do anything requires them to be motivated. If you desire to get your students to do work, listen to you talk, and show up to class, you have to understand what drives and motivated them. Without that understanding you are left trying to forcibly drag a horse, when all it requires is a pat and a nudge."

Motivation is an innate concept, that is both hard and simple to define. Simply, it is why we do what we do. Yet, what drives motivation, the reason behind the why, is significantly more complex. Despite the singular name for motivation, it is not a singular entity; Motivation is highly varied between individuals. While some might value the praise and pride that comes with academic achievement, others simply do not care about it. How are we as educators then supposed to make our students motivated to show up, do the work, and care? Well, like most things the first step is to understand what it is determined by.


## How isn't motivation fixed? 

For motivation, there tends to be four theories of motivation: 

    1. Behaviorist 
    2. Humanist
    3. Cognitive
    4. Sociocultural 
    
While these four theories can be detailed at great length, their summary is as follows:

    1. Motivation is driven by reinforcement and punishment.
    2. Humans follow an innate, hierarchical motivation pattern.
    3. Your expectancy of success and perceived task value determines motivation.
    4. Culture determines motivation.

While these four theories provide a theoretical framework on their own, they sometimes fall flat in explaining the human traits that influence motivation. Futhermore, no theory presented makes sense isolated: value is often reinforced by consequences, but sometimes it isn't; hierarchical motivation is usually culturally structured; expectancy of success is often determined by past feedback, etc. 

Therefore, we will take an integrative approach and try and move away from these theories, but tying them together in the application. 

## Motivation is both socially- and self-determined

Ryan and Deci (2000), performed research on motivation across fields based on fundamental psychological needs. They postulated that humans have an innate inclination toward activity, curiosity, and integration, but deal with a vulnerability toward passivity. According to Ryan and Deci (2020), the social context becomes then crucial, either enforcing the innate inclination, or exploiting the vulnerability. Furthermore, Ryan and Deci (2000) outline that motivation generally falls in one of two categories, either external or internal, what they sometimes call authentic. External is as it sounds, we are motivated by external consequences. While internal is an intrinsic motivation where the individual seeks out challenges and tasks only by virtue of their innate wants.   

Despite intrinsic motivation being innate, it is not steady across people. It is varied. Ryan and Deci (2020) explain this variability by referencing another article they wrote 1985; In this article they proposed Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET) and underpin three innate psychological needs that influence intrinsic motivation: competence, relatedness, and autonomy. The following terms are discussed based on Ryan and Deci (2020). 

## Competence

Competence is the self-perceived ability and capacity to be efficacious in undertaking a specific task. In other cognitive theory is is called the expectancy of success. If an individual is uncertain about their own ability to perform a certain task, they will be less intrinsically motivated to perform that task. The individual needs to feel effective in their interaction with the environment and being able to express their capacities and capabilities. 

Thereby, competence is not about feeling highly-skilled, but about understanding and being able to properly manage challenge and express one's own capabilities. In a situation where the application of a skill is unclear one's competence might feel low, even if the level of the demanded skill is high. Since the application, the expression of capacity, is uncertain, then the competence becomes uncertain.

Competence is then rooted in self-perception and experiences, often behaviorally enforced. A person with a maladaptive self-perception will experience inflated or insufficient competence. Additionally, without sufficient experience one's intrinsic motivation becomes unclear, and often apprehensive, left wanting for more experience to see if one can properly express their capacity. This explains why we are often left afraid of being the first to do something; we are waiting for a frame of reference to gauge our competence.

Despite competence being a fundamental component of our intrinsic motivation, according to Ryan and Deci (2020) it becomes ineffective without autonomy. 

## Autonomy 

Autonomy is as it sounds, if the individual feels as if their actions are self-regulated, voluntary, and personally endorsed, then the motivation increases. Actions need also be ego-syntonic, where an action feels aligned with one's own intrapersonal environment. Furthermore, the methodology has the same requirements. If an individual felt that a specific task was voluntary and ego-syntonic, but the method of the task was controlled and set in an ego-dystonic way, then the intrinsic motivation would be diminished.

The actions done under true autonomy are done for the inherent satisfaction that comes along with them, and, crucially, are done in a way that the individual determines. Thereby, choice and control becomes a clear factor in the flourishing of autonomic intrinsic motivation, while control becomes a detriment. An individual should not feel as if there is only one way to complete their task, rather they need to feel in control and as if the action or methodology is choosable. 

## Relatedness

Ryan and Deci (2000) outline that in studies of infant motivation, there is a clear pattern that infants with a secure attachment bond with their parents, enact more exploratory behavior, the observational consequence of infant motivation. Studies surrounding children have a similar tendency, being more intrinsically motivated in the presence of an affirming and kind stranger, compared to a cold one. They then hypothesize that the same is true for the social contexts of adults; We crave a social connection and security, without which we feel unmotivated and afraid. Ryan and Deci (2000) call this relatedness. 

Our social bonds, and overarching social context, creates a feeling that secures our motivational foundation. Moreover, relatedness plays a key part in our process of internalization, which Ryan and Deci (2000) explain is our ability to adopt externally regulated behaviors as our own, given they are ego-syntonic. Internalization allows individuals to take external values and motivations and turn them into intrinsic values and motivations. It is through internalization some students turn the external motivation of academic status into an internally motivating value. Through relatedness, secure social bonds and context, the internalization process is facilitated.

Therefore, the social context, not only the task itself, becomes vital to ensuring an intrinsic motivation. 


## Cultural considerations 

From a sociocultural perspective, individual motivation is determined by the culture of the person. The values of the culture is instilled in the individual when they are growing up. The culture can range from the overarching social culture of the country, to the culture of the family. All of the cultures an individual is brought up with will then impact their motivation. An individual from an academic-focused social culture will be more intrinsically motivated to pursue academia from a cultural perspective. However, no one has the same cultural mix as any other person. It then becomes important to understand the impact culture has on a person to understand their motivations. 

## Where does this leave us?

Motivation is highly individualistic, yet determined by similar traits. A students feeling of competence, autonomy, and relatedness for any single task will impact how motivated they are to do it. To ensure motivation in students the external factors, such as social context and reward, need to be empowering the traits required, not undermining it. Generally this will require a focus on effort, good social bonds, an avoidance of control, a lack of reward-focused motivation, and a supportive environment. Yet, importantly, motivation will never look the same for everyone.
