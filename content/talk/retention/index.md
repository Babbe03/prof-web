## Frequent low-stakes tests

Intersperse your curriculum with quizzes and small tests that hold little stakes. These quizzes should ideally be used at end of class or at the beginning of class, with different benefits to each. The end of the class quiz should focus more on encoding, while the beginning of class should focus on retrieval. However, it is in the students' interest to vary the format of the quizze, to not only use the same format repeatedly.

Given that the end of class quiz will likely cover the material just presented, the focus should lie in having students generate answers and summaries about the topics. Instead of just giving them answers that they choose between, they should be prompted to answer in their own words, forcing them to generate answers to topics they have just learned in one way. The generation of answers will require them to put the concepts into words. 

Quizzes at the beginning of class ought to have a less encoding and more recollective approach. These quizzes often cover material taught days before, and thereby the demand for perfect wording and recollection should be less. However, these quizzes should instead act as an incentive for the students to try and recall, to think back to what was said, and to try and retrieve their memories. 

These quizzes should be frequently given. While it is possible to have one every class, that type of frequency makes it predictable. Instead, have it be a weekly thing, but no indication of when and where The students should be taken by surprise when it happens while still being given frequent opportunities to practice. Important to note is that they need to be low-stakes, or even incentivised, to ensure that students are just focusing on learning the material and not performing at a certain level.

*Why this application?*

Frequent practice gives students several opportunities for practice, helping them reach automaticity. Furthermore, by giving them quizzes both for encoding an retrieving they are being trained in both; given time to practice their encoding skills through generative processes, and retrieval skills through recollection. The process of generating also creates a increased effect of encoding and retention. By varyin the timing and hpoefully the structure of the quizzes, students are given varied situations where they need to apply their skills, which ensures that they do not simply get into the rhythm and cognitive disengagement of repeated, straight practice. 

## Have students generate summaries about their learning

This application can be used as an alternative to low-stakes quizzes. If quizzes are too much, then students should at least be asked to generate a summary of specific topics or what they have learned. These summaries should either be targeted at topics that are difficult and hard to grasp, or be general and cover large swaths of material. These summaries should only be one or two sentences long, and can be submitted but should not be required or graded. The point is to have students probe their own knowledge and be able to generate summaries. If these are being submitted, then the professor should quickly look over them and see certain things. If the summary was about a specific topic then look over the summaries and notice any patterns of misunderstanding or a lack of detail. Any pattern noticed should be covered in class to clear things up. If the summaries were general, then look for any material that might be missing in a majority of the summaries. Look at what clearly stuck with them, and what did not. Then in the lesson one can cover the material missed by the class to make up for the lack of understanding. 

*Why this application?*

Generating summaries are a great way of encoding material by making students go through their understanding and putting it to words, increasing encoding and being a moment of retrieval. If they are to be submitted then students experience a challenge of making the summary presentable and understandable. The challenge then helps students hopefully reach automaticity. Furthermore, the summaries work as teacher feedback and can be used to gather what has worked and what has not, allowing the professor to make an addendum to the material, ensuring that all students are on the same page regarding the material. 

## Conect to the real-world 

Your material should always have a connection to the real-world. Depending on the material this becomes either more or less difficult. Yet, even if it is difficult there should be times where the material is anchored in real-world experiences and examples. There are several ways to do this: create examples from life events, have students generate connections to the real-world, anchor questions in the real-world, etc. Anytime you can create a connection to a real-world example or topic, you should. 

The most ideal application of this is to get students to create their own associations between material and real-world topics. An example of this in class is to simply ask students to come up with ways that the material can be applied in certain scenarios. Such as how can developmental psychology be applied and thereby understood in the real world? Which domains does it help with? These questions can always be interspersed in the material, but should never remain rhetorical. Students should actively generate answers to these questions, not just think about it. 

*Why this application?*

Connections to the real-world creates a deeper process of cognitive engagement with the material, encouraging a more robust encoding. Moreover, real-world applications becomes a varied challenge from the repeated nature of theoretical learning, giving students a new type of practice they can anchor on to and learn from. If students are forced to generate they are further engaging in deep encoding practices. All of this together creates a scenario where students are able to deeply engage with the material, leading to greater encoding.

## Teach smaller components first

During your lessons, any complex task should be divided into several parts where you go part-by-part ensuring mastery within these parts. When mastery has been reached within the individual parts, then they can be added together and be shown as a whole, illuminating on the complex topic at hand. The crucial aspect of this application is gradually working to the whole; students need to be given time and opportunities to first deal with smaller steps before moving on to combining them. When combining them, the professor has to illustrate how all of these steps create the complex issue. It needs to be illuminated so that students can understand that this complex, difficult task and issue, is simply a collection of smaller tasks.


*Why this application?*

By teaching smaller components first, students undergo part-whole training, in which they are able to master small steps before combining them. In doing so, they are able to increase their confidence in their competence, that otherwise would not be there if simply faced with the big issue. Furthermore, the view of a large complex task as a collection of smaller steps helps students gain a deeper understanding of the issue, and then be able to remember it more easily through remembering the steps needed.
