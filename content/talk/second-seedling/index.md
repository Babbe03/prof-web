The discussion of application will be rooted in the discussion outlined under the *Theory* section, and specifically call back to the 7 aspects highlighted there. 

The application techniques will be explained in detail so that you can use them directly, then at the end will be a more theoretical explanation.

## Give clear guidelines for assignments

During any assignment, whether a presentation, project, essay, or exam, be open and honest to your student about your grading criteria. If you have a spreadsheet that explains your process, then give it to them. If you do not have any firm and concrete guidelines, then at least discuss with your students about what you are grading after, what are the qualities you will be looking at, and what are things you do not want to see. Keeping this a secret does not help your students, and instead makes them unsure of how to proceed.

*Why this application?*

Feedback should be centered around the discrepancy between student's goals and behaviors, and the professor's goal. Yet, often this discrepancy arrives because of unclear guidelines, as mentioned in the first aspect in the theory section, to clarify good performance. This shifts the responsibility, instead of your feedback being clarifying after the assignment, your initial guidelines is clarifying. This removes that burden on feedback and allows for you to focus on individual student traits and outcomes. 

## Never give feedback without apprecitating effort

When grading students assignments, even if it is of substandard quality, there should be something indicating an appreciation for the amount of effort put in. Even if a student handed in a bare-minimum paper, they still handed it in. This should be vocally appreciated. This does not need to be grandiose, rather simply writing or saying "Good work!", "I appreciate the effort!", or even "Thank you for submitting your work!" goes a long way. 

*Why this application?*

Student performance is largely implicated by self-esteem and motivation. When feedback acknowledges student effort it makes them feel more appreciated and competent boosting their motivation and self-esteem. Application that does not do this also looses certain qualitative value for the student; When feedback becomes a robotic transmission of information it becomes harder for the student to fully absorb it. 

## Ask for the student's own feedback 

During the assignments given, ask students to provide their own mid-assignment feedback. This will look different depending on the project given, and is unlikely to work for exams. However, for most projects and essays it is very feasible to ask students to send in a quick self-reflective feedback, where they outline how the project is going, and state their goals. Examples of questions to ask them are:

    1. What is their goal with their project?
    2. What do they need to do to reach it?
    3. What do they feel is going according to plan?
    4. What is not going to plan?
    5. What might have caused it?
    
*Why this application?*

By asking the students to provide their own feedback they get trained in self-regulation, where they learn to reflect on their own work, the behaviors that have shaped it, and why it might not be going according to plan. Thus, it will build their ability to recognize discrepancies on their own, at the same time as it will give you an idea of their goals. When you become cognizant of their goals, and gain some insights into their attributions for successes or failures, you get more to work off of during your own feedback.  

## Focus on dicrepancy 



## Give multiple chances
