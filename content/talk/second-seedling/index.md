The discussion of application will be rooted in the discussion outlined under the *Theory* section, and specifically call back to the 7 aspects highlighted there. 

The application techniques will be explained in detail so that you can use them directly, then at the end will be a more theoretical explanation.

## Give clear guidelines for assignments

During any assignment, whether a presentation, project, essay, or exam, be open and honest to your student about your grading criteria. If you have a spreadsheet that explains your process, then give it to them. If you do not have any firm and concrete guidelines, then at least discuss with your students about what you are grading after, what are the qualities you will be looking at, and what are things you do not want to see. Keeping this a secret does not help your students, and instead makes them unsure of how to proceed.

*Why this application?*

Feedback should be centered around the discrepancy between student's goals and behaviors, and the professor's goal. Yet, often this discrepancy arrives because of unclear guidelines, as mentioned in the first aspect in the theory section, to clarify good performance. This shifts the responsibility, instead of your feedback being clarifying after the assignment, your initial guidelines is clarifying. This removes that burden on feedback and allows for you to focus on individual student traits and outcomes. 

## Never give feedback without apprecitating effort

When grading students assignments, even if it is of substandard quality, there should be something indicating an appreciation for the amount of effort put in. Even if a student handed in a bare-minimum paper, they still handed it in. This should be vocally appreciated. This does not need to be grandiose, rather simply writing or saying "Good work!", "I appreciate the effort!", or even "Thank you for submitting your work!" goes a long way. 

*Why this application?*

Student performance is largely implicated by self-esteem and motivation. When feedback acknowledges student effort it makes them feel more appreciated and competent boosting their motivation and self-esteem. Application that does not do this also looses certain qualitative value for the student; When feedback becomes a robotic transmission of information it becomes harder for the student to fully absorb it. 

## Ask for the student's own feedback 

During the assignments given, ask students to provide their own mid-assignment feedback. This will look different depending on the project given, and is unlikely to work for exams. However, for most projects and essays it is very feasible to ask students to send in a quick self-reflective feedback, where they outline how the project is going, and state their goals. Examples of questions to ask them are:

    1. What is their goal with their project?
    2. What do they need to do to reach it?
    3. What do they feel is going according to plan?
    4. What is not going to plan?
    5. What might have caused it?
    
*Why this application?*

By asking the students to provide their own feedback they get trained in self-regulation, where they learn to reflect on their own work, the behaviors that have shaped it, and why it might not be going according to plan. Thus, it will build their ability to recognize discrepancies on their own, at the same time as it will give you an idea of their goals. When you become cognizant of their goals, and gain some insights into their attributions for successes or failures, you get more to work off of during your own feedback.  

## Focus on dicrepancy 

When providing feedback, while it is tempting to focus on outcomes based off of grading guidelines, all feedback given should be rooted in the discrepancy between the student's desired outcome and actual outcome. If the student only reaches a certain grade below what you might want, but the student is happy with it, then it is the professor's job not to create feedback that outlines the project as unsuccessful. Feedback should always include ways of improving, as well as what went well, but if the desired outcome is aligned with the desired outcome, then that should be recognized and applauded. In order to do this it is important to make the feedback structure a dialogue, where the student can explain how they feel about the performance and are able to respond to your feedback. Once this dialogue is taking shape, if the student's desired outcomes mirrors their actual ones, that should be recognized and praised by the professor. If the outcomes are not aligned, the professor should ask the student what they think caused the discrepancy and then the professor should give their ideas and tips for how to close the gap. 

*Why this application?*

It is easy for feedback to become about reaching certain milestones. Yet, the professor is never able to decide which milestone is appropriate or not, it is always up to the student. Therefore, it is important to create a dialogue where the student can express their feelings of content or discontent about the performance. Then the professor is able to work with the student on closing the gap through collaborative feedback. This helps the student learn to self-regulate, identify problematic behaviors, and to get more insight. 

## Reflect on the feedback you give 

When administering feedback to students, look out for any patterns or trends within the feedback given. Any trend might be due to a lack of comprehensive and understandable teaching. A lack of understanding in a specific area, a question most students got wrong, a part of the project significantly weaker than other areas, might all point to a lapse in the teaching. To do this well, it is important to both understand your own feedback, but to also get students input on the feedback given. If they are expressing that certain ideas in class seemed vague and unsure then that points to a discrepancy in teaching and expectations. 

*Why this application?*

Feedback goes both ways; when students fail at something it is also a reflection on the teaching given. By absorbing the feedback given to students, the professor can ensure that their teaching imnproves, but also gives students a better way of understanding the professor, the feedback given, and allows them to be undesrtood by the professor, alleviating frustrations.
