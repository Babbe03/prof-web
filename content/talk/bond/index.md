Given the discussion in the *Theory* section, we need to consider the five aspects of student-teacher bonds, those being:

    1. Trust in benevolence
    2. Trust in honesty
    3. Affective commitmnet
    4. Affective conflict 
    5. Satisfcation
    
Out applications to build an emotional bond should then target these five aspects. The application techniques will first be explained in detail so that you can use them directly, then at the end will be a more theoretical explanation.
