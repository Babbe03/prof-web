Based on the Theory, there are four things to center our applications around:

    Allow for Internal/External shifts
    Novelty
    Intensity
    Movement/Motion

The application techniques will not be given in order, but rather explained in detail so that you can use them directly, then at the end will be a more theoretical explanation.   

# Chunk your material

No matter the length of your lecture, take the material and split it up to ~10 minute chunks. These chunks should ideally contain a slight separation of material, e.g. if you are covering Maslow's hierarchy of needs impact on motivation have one chunk be the details of the Maslow's ideas, and one chunk be how it pertains to motivation. While such a clear difference is not always possible, it is not always needed either. There are two factors to consider for your chunks: they cannot be connected by the same technique, and they need to be separated by a moment with a different external/internal focus. External focus means the student's attention is on something outside of their own thoughts, and internal means them focusing on their own thoughts and connections. This should be the case between all of your chunks. 
 
Here's an example of how to separate chunks: 

I have one chunk where I lecture about what t-tests are, and the following chunk is me giving application examples of how to use t-tests. These chunks are externally-focused, given that the students need to be focused on me and the examples. Thereby, the chunks need to be separated by an internal-moment where the students are focused on their own thoughts and make their own connections. Here, at the end of the first chunk, I can ask the students a question, such as "When should we use a t-test over a z-test?", and then give them ample time to think and make connections to the previous material. After giving them this shift of attention, I can then lead in to the next chunk, covering the answers to the question posed. 

This same thought process can be used even if the chunks are internal, e.g. chunks of self-writing be intercepted by a moment of the professor lecturing. 
  
# Differentiate your chunks 

When starting a new chunk and covering (hopefully) new information, use a different technique to cover it. If the previous chunk was lecture-based, consider using a different way of presenting the material, such as videos, real-life applications, discussion-questions. If there is no way to use a different pedagogical technique, then change the details about the technique. The key aspect is to ensure that you are not presenting new information with the same presentation, but giving your students new type of presentation or medium so that they can more easily latch on to it. 

Examples of this would be showing a video that addresses the new topic instead of continuing a lecture format. If I am lecturing and have to keep lecturing about the new chunk then I will simply try to at least change the details surrounding my lecture. If I was using a PowerPoint I might change the theme of the slides, or create a new color and font, or switch to using a drawing board instead of a power point. 

# Don't be afraid to give them the wheel 

A great way of ensuring attention is payed, is by putting the brunt of the lifting on them. Instead of the students being a spectator they are now in charge of the material. This could include giving them material that they then need to discuss in class, or make them present their ideas about a material before going into the professor-led part of the class.
