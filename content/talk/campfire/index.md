Based on the Theory, there are four things to center our applications around:

    Allow for Internal/External shifts
    Novelty
    Intensity
    Movement/Motion

The application techniques will be explained in detail so that you can use them directly, then at the end will be a more theoretical explanation.   

# Chunk your material

No matter the length of your lecture, take the material and split it up to ~10 minute chunks. These chunks should ideally contain a slight separation of material, e.g. if you are covering Maslow's hierarchy of needs impact on motivation have one chunk be the details of the Maslow's ideas, and one chunk be how it pertains to motivation. While such a clear difference is not always possible, it is not always needed either. There are two factors to consider for your chunks: they cannot be connected by the same technique, and they need to be separated by a moment with a different external/internal focus. External focus means the student's attention is on something outside of their own thoughts, and internal means them focusing on their own thoughts and connections. This should be the case between all of your chunks. 
 
Here's an example of how to separate chunks: 

I have one chunk where I lecture about what t-tests are, and the following chunk is me giving application examples of how to use t-tests. These chunks are externally-focused, given that the students need to be focused on me and the examples. Thereby, the chunks need to be separated by an internal-moment where the students are focused on their own thoughts and make their own connections. Here, at the end of the first chunk, I can ask the students a question, such as "When should we use a t-test over a z-test?", and then give them ample time to think and make connections to the previous material. After giving them this shift of attention, I can then lead in to the next chunk, covering the answers to the question posed. 

This same thought process can be used even if the chunks are internal, e.g. chunks of self-writing be intercepted by a moment of the professor lecturing. 
  

*Why this application?* 

By splitting up your sections you shorten the demand of attention to ca. 10 minutes, which is what most humans handle without breaking significantly. Beyond that, by giving a moment between chunks where you change the form of attention required and break the flow, you create a new instance that the students are more likely to pay attention to, and give time for a form of attention that might otherwise become distracting.   

# Differentiate your chunks 

When starting a new chunk and covering (hopefully) new information, use a different technique to cover it. If the previous chunk was lecture-based, consider using a different way of presenting the material, such as videos, real-life applications, discussion-questions. If there is no way to use a different pedagogical technique, then change the details about the technique. The key aspect is to ensure that you are not presenting new information with the same presentation, but giving your students new type of presentation or medium so that they can more easily latch on to it. 

Examples of this would be showing a video that addresses the new topic instead of continuing a lecture format. If I am lecturing and have to keep lecturing about the new chunk then I will simply try to at least change the details surrounding my lecture. If I was using a PowerPoint I might change the theme of the slides, or create a new color and font, or switch to using a drawing board instead of a power point. 

*Why this application?*

Novelty plays a key role in determining if we should pay attention or not. Most students stop paying attention because something becomes drawn-out and feels like its droning on. When introducing a new chunk it becomes then vital to differentiate it from the preceding moments. This tells the students that there is something new, and gives them a new way of paying attention, easing thei demand to retain their attention. 

# Don't be afraid to give them the wheel 

A great way of ensuring attention is payed, is by putting the brunt of the lifting on them. Instead of the students being a spectator they are now in charge of the material. This could include giving them material that they then need to discuss in class, or make them present their ideas about a material before going into the professor-led part of the class. While most often we think of a flipped classroom as being group-based, it can also be individual-led; having each student be responsible for their own material. The key components to ensuring this works is to make them accountable and to give them clear instructions. If they do not feel accountable for the material they are less likely to put ample work into it, this can be mitigated by making them send in their work, present it, or point out that it will be on the exam. A lack of clear instructions will lead to the flipped side of the classroom being unsure what they are supposed to do, and potentially doing the wrong thing. 


*Why this application?*

When students are forced to take on the responsibility and intensity of their own teaching, by determining and discussing materials themselves, they are more likely to keep significant attention on the material, because if they do not they will not be able to work with it. Compared to regular professor-led teaching, this style creates a pressure that forces attention from students. However, if the pressure becomes too much then they might be overwhelmed. 

# Create room to breathe

During your classes, it is important to give time for fluctuations in attention. While creating chunk separation helps, by also creating pauses in your material even more time can be given. These pauses are not meant to be minute-long pauses where people should hold hands and breathe (although that probably is helpful), but rather one or two moments where nothing is being said, to give a quick moment for the students- and your own- brain to relax and reset. In these moments, you as the professor can be preparing what you are gonna say, prepping your computer for a new PowerPoint, or even just standing in silence. The important thing is that time is given. If you are constantly going at a pace that never gets a pause, then students might fall behind and give up. If you want students to pay extra attention to any specific sentence or words, then saying it, pausing, and repeating it ensures that students who are listening get time to understand what you are saying, and students who are tuned out will tune back in due to the pause. 

*Why this application?*

Similarly to the first application, this allows time for students to circumvent attention shifts, by giving them small opportunities to tune out, so that they can later tune back in. Furthermore, it gives novelty to what comes after the pause, because instead of it being one large thread, it gets separated and given new weight when it becomes said.
