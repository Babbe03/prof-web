Fostering motivation requires consideration of four traits: 

    1. Competence 
    2. Autonomy
    3. Relatedness
    4. Culture
    
The application techniques will be explained in detail so that you can use them directly, then at the end will be a more theoretical explanation.

## Progressive Challenge

When designing your curriculum, create a progressive and growing increase in challenge and demand. If the class is focused on writing essays, then start the semester by the students practicing their writing. The ramp up of challenge should model the development of student skills, not forcing them to do anything they have not practiced. While practice sounds lofty and grandiose, it can often be as simple as a quick test assignment. To develop writing skills give your students a 1-page paper. To cultivate multiple-choice skill give them a pop-quiz. To prepare them for presentations have them present their opinions to their classmates. This will give your students time to develop skills before they are put under pressure, and then allow them to naturally approach the final assignments of the class.

*Why this application?*

To ensure a feeling of competence in the individual it is important to allow them to understand the expression of skill and capacity needed. By allowing them to develop their initial skill in a low-stakes environment, and then progress alongside the assignments, they are able to feel more competent and certain of the skill demonstration needed, increasing their motivation to do so.


## Allow students to choose 

For any project or paper, allow the students to choose their own topics. Topics can be selected from a range of options, or entirely self-chosen by the student. The topics should be directly related to class material and might as such require approval firstly. Even for projects that need to be centered around a specific topic, the students can be given choice and control in how they choose to discuss the topic, including their personal opinions, and the format of the project. Any amount of control and choice that can be given to the student, should be given. 

Instead of giving specific questions, you can give themes. While it is tempting to give students one specific thing to think about, it is often more fruitful to give them the underlying themes, and asking them to choose the questions themselves. 

Furthermore, if there is a spot in your curriculum where you are unsure of what to present, let the students choose. Professors are often inclined to not show any uncertain feelings, or any dilemmas. However, in a scenario where the professor must make a choice of what topic to cover for the students, it becomes fruitful to include the students into the choice. If they are given control over the material they are given, then the motivation will increase. They become an agent in the layout of their own education, and can choose what suits them best. 

*Why this application?*

By having students choose, and giving them control, you give them a sense of autonomy that allows them to do work that is naturally aligned with their personal beliefs and interest. Furthermore, by giving them agency to structure and outline their own work they are given an increased sense of competency through a clear and known frame of how they should express their capabilities. 

## Give Moments to Socialize

While it is easy to get wrapped up in just teaching and teaching, not paying heed to the student's social scenario, it is pivotal to take any moment you can to allow students to feel connected in their environment. 

From a assignment perspective, this can mean giving them group projects to allow the students to work with one another and gain social bonds through their work. The idea is then for the students to get closer to one another through their work, or at least find someone whom they can relate to and feel connected with. 

Group project might not fit every classroom, in such a case peer-review becomes extremely useful. Peer-review gives students an opportunity to read and critique each others work, practicing associated skills, but also gives them someone who they can anchor to, both in terms of social context and in terms of competence. 

During class it is important to both ask questions but also to get students' answers. Rhetorical questions are useful in terms of getting students to think. But, importantly, getting students to answer will allow you to get an understanding of their thoughts, and, crucially, allow other students to get an insight into what other students feel and think. Even if all students do not, and they will not, want to answer, those who do then become an anchoring point for the other students: allowing them to feel connected. The questions can both be asked in the larger setting, where students need to raise their hands and answer, but can also be asked an answered in small groups of the students choosing.

*Why this application?*

To create a feeling of relatedness the students need to feel socially connected and find an anchor point for a feeling of relating. By giving students a chance to talk to one another you give them opportunities to find their anchor point, to find some way of feeling connected to their social environment. Unfortunately, you cannot force students to create social bonds, but as a professor you need to at least provide ample opportunity for them to form, and cautiously assess the social progress.
