  I aspire to be a professor, yet I noticed that professors receive significantly less instruction and education around education. The quality of education I received from professors at Vanderbilt University varied greatly, making me feel that most professors do what they feel is best with little instruction. 
  
  This highlighted the lack of accessible resources for professors. Therefore, when given a final project in my Ed Psych class, I immediately knew I wanted to create a resource for current professors and aspiring ones like myself. 
  
  This project covers five areas I deem essential to a successful professorship. I present the theory behind these areas and their application so you can leave with a greater understanding and a richer practice. I have also included quotes from professors and students on what makes a good professor. I hope this provides you with sufficient insight into how to be a professor. 
  
  All information is taken from class notes unless otherwise specified. A page with references can be found in the headers; other resources of interest to the individual with ardor can be included. Feel free to start reading about the *Theory* of the areas or dive straight into *Application* if you wish.
