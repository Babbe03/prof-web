  My aspiration is to be a professor, yet I noticed that professors receive significantly less instruction and education around, well, education. The quality of education I received from professors at Vanderbilt University varied greatly, making me feel that most professors are simply doing what they feel is best with little instruction. Whether that is true or not is up for debate.
  
  But, it did highlight to me the lack of accessible resources for professors. Therefore, when given a final project in my Ed Psych class I immediatley knew I wanted to create a resource for both current professors, but also aspiring ones like myself. 
  
  This project covers 5 areas I deemed essential to successful professorship. I present the theory behind these areas, and the application of them, so that you can leave with a greater understanding and a richer practice. I have also included quotes from professors and students on what makes a good professor. I hope all of this provides you with sufficient insight into how to be a professor. 
  
  All information is taken from class notes, unless otherwise specified. A page with references can be found in the headers, and will include other resources of interest to the individual with ardor.
