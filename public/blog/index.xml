      <description>Attention is such a fundamental concept that it seems pointless to discuss what it actually means. However, any fundamental concept always carries with it misconceptions perpetuated through tradition. Thereby, it seems most fitting to start with these misconceptions, and then move on to the implications of their dispelling.&#xA;1. Attention is not continuous. An experiment done by Bunce et al. in the chemistry department at the Catholic University of America was designed to answer three questions regarding student attention:</description>

      <description>Motivation is an innate concept, that is both hard and simple to define. Simply, it is why we do what we do. Yet, what drives motivation, the reason behind the why, is significantly more complex. Despite the singular name for motivation, it is not a singular entity; Motivation is highly varied between individuals. While some might value the praise and pride that comes with academic achievement, others simply do not care about it.</description>

      <description>Everyone reading this has both received and sent out a lot of feedback. Despite this, being able to formulate what is good feedback is still difficult. Is good feedback outcome-oriented, effort-based, unconditionally positive; should its purpose be to motivate, to increase academic outcome, to bring comfort? The difficult part of intuitively getting a definition is that everything seems correct. Feedback should both focus on outcome and effort, it should be positive yet constructive, it should bring comfort while motivating, and ultimately it should ensure positive academic outcomes.</description>

      <description>Despite the criticality of ensuring retention, most professors seem to abide by a fairly straight forward approach to ensuring it: &amp;ldquo;if I understand it and can explain my understanding, then they should be able to understand also&amp;rdquo;. Therefore, it may be of no surprise that upon learning the material, students are better than professors at explaining the concepts in a varied way to other students. This deficit in inability to vary teaching often explains many gripes some students have with their professors.</description>

      <description>Many of us have a teacher or professor whom we remember fondly. That educator did something that made us feel connected to them, and subsequently more engaged and interested in the material, as well as feeling better. This is the impact of a student-teacher emotional bond. Yet, many of us do not fully understand the impact these bonds have, what they actually do, and then how to build them. This section will cover the benefits and mechanisms of a quality student-teacher bond, and the Application section will delve into how to build it.</description>
