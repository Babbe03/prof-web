        <p>Everyone reading this has both received and sent out a lot of feedback. Despite this, being able to formulate what is good feedback is still difficult. Is good feedback outcome-oriented, effort-based, unconditionally positive; should its purpose be to motivate, to increase academic outcome, to bring comfort? The difficult part of intuitively getting a definition is that everything seems correct. Feedback should both focus on outcome and effort, it should be positive yet constructive, it should bring comfort while motivating, and ultimately it should ensure positive academic outcomes. However, that does not give us a strong idea of how to approach it. Therefore, we will start discussing what good feedback should be, and some myths around it.</p>

<p>Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006), in their paper about feedback and educational self-regulation, recount that traditionally students have bene viewed in a passivity and reactivity regarding feedback; The professor gives the student feedback, and without the professors proactivity, no feedback would be given. However, Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) challenge that idea, explaining that students, throughout their own work, continuously self-assess, regularly performing and giving themselves feedback. They then say that students do not work without monitoring, a metacognitive skill, their own progress. The implications of this feedback-shift, is to instead view students as someone who needs clear third-party feedback, but not as someone in a dearth of it. What a student requires then, according to Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006), is for the educator to provide feedback that builds upon the student&rsquo;s feedback, increasing their ability to perform self-regulation and academic success.</p>
<p>Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) propose a conceptual model to explain the interaction between internal and external processes in the monitoring of a task. [1] The teacher sets the task for the student. [2] The student internally gathers domain knowledge, strategy knowledge, and motivational beliefs, [3] creating student goals. [4] Then the student assess which strategies and tactics needed to reach the desired internal [5] and external [6] goals. Then [7] external feedback might be given, augmenting, conflicting with, or supplementing the [2] internally gathered knowledge and beliefs. Important to note in the model, is that throughout the entire process, the students self-regulatory processes provide internal feedback to each part [1-6], influencing their decisions, goals, strategies, and perceived knowledge.</p>
<p>To support this knowledge, Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) propose 7 crucial parts of good feedback, which then endorses student self-regulation.</p>

<p>Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) explain that for a student to reach the goal they must understand the goals. In most academic settings the teacher&rsquo;s goal hopefully overlaps with the student&rsquo;s goal, therefore the teacher must ensure that the goal that is being set is fully clear and understandable. However, they outline that often there is a mismatch between the teacher&rsquo;s goal and the student&rsquo;s, and that poor mismatch is a significant predictor for poor assignment outcomes. When students are unsure of the goals set by the educator, they are left unsure of how to proceed, and perform worse.</p>
<p>Feedback then gains a new goal. Instead of only being an assessment regarding performance, it should also reaffirm the goals and give a structured way there.</p>

</h2>
<p>Self-assessment is a crucial skills for students to have, and according to Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006), and leads to significantly higher academic performance. Therefore, for feedback to be successful it should encourage and lead to higher degrees of self-assessment. Given that students, according to Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) are already engaged in self-assesment feedback only needs to nudge them onwards. Feedback should leave students wondering about their own work, probing it for a greater understanding of their errors and successes. It should not leave them with a direct answer about all they did, rather leave them equipped for a critical view of their own work.</p>
<p>Ideally, this aspect of feedback aligns with the previous, where feedback can use the standards and guidelines provided to get the student to think about it they were successful in reaching the goals set by their educator and by themselves.</p>

<p>While self-assessment is a virtue for students to have, educators are still more equipped to deal with providing feedback than students themselves or their peers. Even still there is little agreement upon what aspects should be included in feedback. Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) propose that high-quality feedback provides students with an answer for the discrepancy between their intentions and the results. If the students are writing an essay, and their intention are in complete misalignment with the execution, then the professor needs to provide feedback on what went wrong; why the intentions did not come to fruition. Students often do not need help understanding that there is a discrepancy, it is often felt through self-assessment, but the way in which the discrepancy takes shape, and how to approach it, is valuable, high-quality information that should be provided in the feedback of the educator.</p>

<p>Often, students do not understand the information that the professor tries to transmit to them through feedback. When feedback is not understood, academic outcomes are lowered. Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) explain that professors tend to view feedback as a transmission of information that will subsequently give students the knowledge they need to improve. Yet, this often creates a stiff and inanimate feedback for students that then becomes hard to grasp. Instead, Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) suggest that feedback should be viewed as a <em>dialogue</em> between student and teacher. This does not require a physical discussion, but rather a format that allows students to engage with the feedback, ask questions and for clarification, and having peers work together with their feedback. The importance of this, according to Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick, is to create an environment where feedback becomes integrated and discussed, instead of simply being professed.</p>

<p>Feedback should not only focus on outcomes. Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) stress the importance of motivation and self-esteem in an educational setting, and that for students to be willing to continue working at their best, they need to feel motivated. Therefore, the feedback given by professors, while still upholding all of the previous traits, should also focus on student effort. If the students only receive feedback on what they can improve, without getting recognized for the large amount of effort put in, then they will feel bereaved and defeated, as if all of their hard work was for nothing. To circumvent this it is important to pay attention to the effort given, even if it was not applied in the best way. Given the need for effort and information, optimal feedback should underline and applaud the effort while providing information on how to apply that effort in a more goal-aligned sense.</p>

<p>During the course of assignments, students will have a desired performance, and an actual one, that often end up misaligned. Students will then feel lost and unsure of how to proceed, wondering why their current behaviors are not leading them to their desired situation. The role of the professor then, according to Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick, is to give regular feedback, during the assignment, that gives them an idea of how to change their behaviors to reach their goal. Ideally then, feedback should not just be given after the assignment, but also during it to ensure that students are able to understand how to change their actionable behaviors, and reach their desired performance.</p>

<p>When a professor is in the process of assessing student&rsquo;s knowledge and learning, it is of vital importance for them to understand that they are also assessing their own teaching. The student gains knowledge through the transmission of information by virtue of education. If that education is faulty, or slanted in any way, it will show in the student&rsquo;s performance. Therefore, Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) stress the absolute importance of educators being insightful and introspective when assessing students. Professors must think &ldquo;What does this say about my teaching?&rdquo; continuously throughout the feedback, and then take the information given and create action from it. Without an introspective view of feedback, students will never be able to learn to their fullest potential, and the professor will never be able to teach from their fullest potential.</p>

<p>Feedback is a complex interwoven series of traits that professors need to always be able to administer. The difficult part of feedback is also its most valuable: feedback impacts a lot of aspects that in turn affect academic outcome. It is crucial for a professor to be able to administer feedback, but also accept it. This theoretical discussion should provide insight into what to consider, and for practical application of these ideas, go to the <em>Application</em> section.</p>
