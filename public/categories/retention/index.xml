      <description>Frequent low-stakes tests Intersperse your curriculum with quizzes and small tests that hold little stakes. These quizzes with different benefits should be used at the end or the beginning of class. The end-of-class quiz should focus more on encoding, while the beginning-of-class quiz should focus on retrieval. However, it is in the student&amp;rsquo;s interest to vary the format of the quizzes rather than use the same format repeatedly.&#xA;Given that the end-of-class quiz will likely cover the material presented, the focus should be on having students generate answers and summaries about the topics.</description>

      <description>Despite the criticality of ensuring retention, most professors seem to abide by a fairly straightforward approach: &amp;ldquo;If I understand it and can explain my understanding, then they should be able to understand also.&amp;rdquo; Therefore, it is no surprise that upon learning the material, students are better than professors at explaining the concepts in a varied way to other students. This deficit in an inability to vary teaching often explains many students&amp;rsquo; gripes with their professors.</description>
