      <description>Frequent low-stakes tests Intersperse your curriculum with quizzes and small tests that hold little stakes. These quizzes should ideally be used at end of class or at the beginning of class, with different benefits to each. The end of the class quiz should focus more on encoding, while the beginning of class should focus on retrieval. However, it is in the students&amp;rsquo; interest to vary the format of the quizze, to not only use the same format repeatedly.</description>

      <description>Despite the criticality of ensuring retention, most professors seem to abide by a fairly straight forward approach to ensuring it: &amp;ldquo;if I understand it and can explain my understanding, then they should be able to understand also&amp;rdquo;. Therefore, it may be of no surprise that upon learning the material, students are better than professors at explaining the concepts in a varied way to other students. This deficit in inability to vary teaching often explains many gripes some students have with their professors.</description>
