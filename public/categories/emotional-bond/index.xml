      <description>Given the discussion in the Theory section, we need to consider the five aspects of student-teacher bonds, those being:&#xA;1. Trust in benevolence 2. Trust in honesty 3. Affective commitment 4. Affective conflict 5. Satisfaction Out applications to build an emotional bond should then target these five aspects. The application techniques will first be explained in detail so that you can use them directly, and then, at the end, there will be a more theoretical explanation.</description>

      <description>Many of us have a teacher or professor whom we remember fondly. That educator did something that made us feel connected to them and subsequently more engaged and interested in the material, as well as feeling better. That is the impact of a student-teacher emotional bond. Yet, many of us do not fully understand these bonds&amp;rsquo; impact, what they actually do, and how to build them. This section will cover the benefits and mechanisms of a quality student-teacher bond, and the Application section will delve into how to build it.</description>
