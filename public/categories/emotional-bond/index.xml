      <description>Many of us have a teacher or professor whom we remember fondly. That educator did something that made us feel connected to them, and subsequently more engaged and interested in the material, as well as feeling better. This is the impact of a student-teacher emotional bond. Yet, many of us do not fully understand the impact these bonds have, what they actually do, and then how to build them.
